You must refactor ONLY the module under: {scope}

RAG-FIRST RULES:
- Use MODULE_CONTEXT to know what files/classes/params actually exist.
- Use REFERENCE_CONTEXT to decide HOW to refactor (Puppet best practices, patterns, examples).
- Do NOT invent file paths. Only change existing MODULE files, unless you explicitly justify creating a new file.
- Avoid copying large context verbatim. Quote only small snippets if needed.
- For each non-trivial refactor decision, cite at least one reference chunk like: (REF [n]).
- When changing code, be idempotent and Puppet-idiomatic.
